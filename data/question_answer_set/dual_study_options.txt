Q: What are the dual study options available?
A: The Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg offers two dual study options: the combined study program (Verbundstudium) and the study program with enhanced practical experience (Studium mit vertiefter Praxis).

Q: What are the benefits of a dual study program?
A: Both the combined study program and the study program with enhanced practical experience combine the advantages of academic studies with those of vocational training or deepened practical phases in companies. This allows students to gain theoretical knowledge while also obtaining practical experience.

Q: What distinguishes the combined study program from the study program with enhanced practical experience?
A: In the combined study program, students study concurrently with an apprenticeship in a company of their choice, leading to both a degree and a vocational qualification (with IHK/HWK certification). On the other hand, the study program with enhanced practical experience involves intensive practical phases in a company beyond mandatory internships, without pursuing a vocational training.

Q: How does the procedure differ between the two dual study options?
A: Both the combined study program and the study program with enhanced practical experience involve alternating periods at the university and in the workplace. However, the integrated vocational training in the combined study program extends its duration to 4.5 years, while the study program with enhanced practical experience can be completed in 3.5 years.

Q: What are the steps involved in pursuing a combined study program?
A: To pursue a combined study program, students first select a program offered in this format. They then apply for an apprenticeship position at a company that collaborates with the university in the chosen program. Subsequently, they enter into an apprenticeship contract with the company and simultaneously apply for a study place at the university. After about 14 months in the company, they commence their university studies, with alternating phases between the university and the company. The program concludes with a company-oriented bachelor thesis.

Q: How does one go about pursuing a bachelor study program with enhanced practical experience?
A: For a Bachelor-study program with enhanced practical experience, students choose a program available in this format and apply for admission to the university. Concurrently or by the third semester, they apply to a company collaborating with the university in the chosen program. Upon securing a position, they sign an educational contract with the company. Throughout the program, they engage in practical units at the company during lecture-free periods and practical semesters. The program culminates with a company-oriented bachelor thesis.

Q: What is the structure of a master study program with enhanced practical experience?
A: A master study program with enhanced practical experience typically lasts 1.5 years (3 semesters) full-time and is organized as a study program with enhanced practical experience. Students spend a minimum of 34 weeks (or at least half of the standard study duration) in a company. This includes periods during lecture-free times (approximately 4 months or 16 weeks) and during the master thesis phase (minimum 4.5 months or 18 weeks).
